# Insight Cascade

## Summon a Personal Board of Advisors with AI

This repository is a guide to creating a personalized board of AI advisors to support problem-solving, personal growth, and insight. By carefully crafting these advisor personalities and grounding them both in specific cultural lineages (academic, philosophical, spiritual, artistic, etc.) and your own personal aims, you can initiate a mode of conversation that is substantive, surprising, and sometimes deeply meaningful, with more dynamic feedback than journaling.

This is part one of a larger project exploring frameworks and methods for using Large Language Models for personal and social discovery. If you are interested being a part of a community supporting ongoing dialogue, experimentation, and refinement around these practices, get involved [here](https://8t851oj5v8u.typeform.com/to/JeZao3Mi).

## What's Here

* Structured process for discovering and defining your ideal AI advisors
* Tools for refining advisor personalities and expertise
* Framework for ongoing dialogue and journaling
* Safety guidelines and considerations

## Project Principles

1. Maintain awareness. Regularly reflect on your use of AI. When it is helpful, how is it helpful (or not), and why? 
2. Use AI to deepen human relationships — not to avoid, fix, replace, or optimize them.
3. Focus on what you want to see more of in the world.
4. Keep a sense of humor. Perhaps this is nothing but an interesting and temporary game.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Worksheets

- [basic_worksheet.md](Worksheets/basic_worksheet.md): Initial questionnaire to help users identify potential advisor archetypes.
- [detailed_worksheet.md](Worksheets/detailed_worksheet.md): Detailed guide for defining advisor characteristics.

### 2. Prompts

- [1.advisors_search.txt](Prompts/1.advisors_search.txt): Generate initial advisor recommendations.
- [2.advisors_output.txt](Prompts/2.advisors_output.txt): Narrow down and refine advisor personalities.
- [3.journal_startup.txt](Prompts/3.journal_startup.txt): Initiate dialogue with your board of advisors.

### 3. Documentation

- [safety_guidelines.md](safety_guidelines.md): Important considerations for responsible AI interaction.
* **example_sessions/**: Directory containing sample dialogues and use cases (TODO)
* **advisor_templates/**: Collection of pre-crafted advisor archetypes that users can adapt (TODO)

## Prerequisites

* Access to a capable Large Language Model (at the moment we strongly recommend Claude-3.5-Sonnet as it is heads above all affordable competition for this use case)
* Basic understanding of how to prompt LLMs
* Willingness to engage in reflective dialogue

## Getting Started

1. Review the [safety_guidelines.md](safety_guidelines.md) document (really! they're interesting!)
2. Complete the [basic_worksheet.md](Worksheets/basic_worksheet.md) to identify your needs and goals  
3. Paste your filled-out worksheet and the [advisor_search.txt](Prompts/1.advisors_search.txt) prompt to generate potential advisor profiles  
4. In the same chat, refine your selection to three advisors through dialogue  
5. Use the [advisor_refinement.txt](Prompts/2.advisors_output.txt) prompt to pull out your three advisors  
6. Initialize your journal using the [journal_startup.txt](Prompts/3.journal_startup.txt) prompt  
7. Begin dialogue with your board of advisors

*As an optional modulation, you might also include the initial worksheet in your starting prompt. This will cause you to reach the usage limit faster, but will give the LLM richer context to draw from.

## Best Practices

* Use prompting and feedback to maintain conversational integrity
* Document insights and breakthrough moments separately
* Review and refine advisor profiles as needed
* If things get stale, switch up your advisors
* Try new things—there's a huge amount of uncharted territory here
